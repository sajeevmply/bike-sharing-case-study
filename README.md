# BoomBikes Bike-Sharing System
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- Bike sharing system case study using linear regression techniques.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- R2 and Adjusted R2 values of both train and test data falls are 83% and 82% and this shows the data we can explain correctly.
- Increase in holiday, windspeed, spring, snow, mist, January month & july month values will impact the count.
- Increase in year, temp, summer, winter, sep month & saturday values leads to increase in count.
- Temperature, Year, season values are important in predicting the demand of shared bikes.
